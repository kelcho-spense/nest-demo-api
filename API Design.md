# API Design

To create a robust API design for managing courses, departments, lectures, profiles, and students, you'll want to structure your entities in a way that supports clear relationships and efficient queries. Here's an overview of what your entities might look like:

### 1. **Course Entity**

This will represent the individual courses offered in the system.

**Fields:**

* `id`: Unique identifier for the course (e.g., UUID).
* `title`: Name of the course.
* `description`: Detailed description of the course content.
* `departmentId`: Foreign key to the department offering the course.
* `credits`: Number of credits associated with the course.
* `duration`: Duration of the course (e.g., number of weeks or months).
* `startDate`: Start date of the course.
* `endDate`: End date of the course.
* `lectures`: List of lectures associated with the course.
* `createdAt`: Date and time the course was created.
* `updatedAt`: Date and time the course details were last updated.

### 2. **Department Entity**

Represents the different departments in your institution or academy.

**Fields:**

* `id`: Unique identifier for the department.
* `name`: Name of the department (e.g., Computer Science, Business).
* `description`: Description of what the department offers.
* `headOfDepartment`: Name or ID of the faculty member in charge.
* `createdAt`: Date and time the department was created.
* `updatedAt`: Date and time the department details were last updated.

### 3. **Lecturer Entity**

This entity represents individual lectures within a course.

**Fields:**

* `id`: Unique identifier for the lecture.
* `employeeId`: Unique employee identifier
* `courseId`: Foreign key to the associated course.
* `specialization`: Area of expertise
* `bio`: Brief biography
* `officeLocation`: Office or room number
* `phoneNumber`: lecs phone number
* `createdAt`: Date and time the lecture was created.
* `updatedAt`: Date and time the lecture details were last updated.

### 4. **Profile Entity**

This represents both student and faculty profiles in the system. You can differentiate between types of profiles using a field like `role`.

**Fields:**

* `id`: Unique identifier for the profile.
* `firstName`: First name of the individual.
* `lastName`: Last name of the individual.
* `email`: Email address (could be used for login).
* `role`: Specifies if the profile is for a student, faculty, or administrator.
* `departmentId`: Foreign key to the department (for faculty members).
* `courses`: List of courses that the profile (student/faculty) is associated with.
* `createdAt`: Date and time the profile was created.
* `updatedAt`: Date and time the profile was last updated.

### 5. **Student Entity**

This is a specialized version of the `Profile` entity, with additional fields specific to students.

**Fields:**

* `id`: Unique identifier for the student (inherited from Profile).
* `profileId`: Foreign key linking to the Profile entity.
* `enrollmentDate`: Date when the student enrolled.
* `completedCourses`: List of courses the student has completed.
* `currentCourses`: List of courses the student is currently enrolled in.
* `gpa`: Current GPA or performance metric for the student.
* `degreeProgram`: The degree program (e.g., Bachelor's in Computer Science).
* `createdAt`: Date and time the student was created.
* `updatedAt`: Date and time the student details were last updated.

### Entity Relationships

* **Course ↔ Department**: One-to-many relationship. A department can have many courses, but each course belongs to a single department.
* **Course ↔ Lecture**: One-to-many relationship. A course can have many lectures, but each lecture belongs to a single course.
* **Profile ↔ Department**: One-to-many relationship. Faculty profiles are tied to departments.
* **Student ↔ Course**: Many-to-many relationship. A student can be enrolled in multiple courses, and each course can have many students.
* **Student ↔ Profile**: One-to-one relationship. Each student profile corresponds to a single user profile.

    * `GET /departments/{id}`: Get details of a specific department.
    * `POST /departments`: Create a new department.
    * `PUT /departments/{id}`: Update a department.
    * `DELETE /departments/{id}`: Delete a department.
* **Lectures**:
    * `GET /lectures`: Retrieve all lectures.
    * `GET /lectures/{id}`: Get details for a specific lecture.
    * `POST /lectures`: Create a new lecture.
    * `PUT /lectures/{id}`: Update a lecture.
    * `DELETE /lectures/{id}`: Delete a lecture.
* **Profiles**:
    * `GET /profiles`: Retrieve all profiles (students, faculty, etc.).
    * `GET /profiles/{id}`: Get details of a specific profile.
    * `POST /profiles`: Create a new profile.

    * `DELETE /students/{id}`: Delete a student profile.

This structure provides a solid foundation for a course management system API. You can expand on these entities with more detailed attributes or relationships depending on your exact needs. Does this layout look good to you, or would you like to add any specific features?
